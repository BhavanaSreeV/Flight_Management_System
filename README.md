 Flight Management System - Project Overview
**Problem Statement:**
The problem being solved by this project is the need for an efficient system that enables customers to easily book flight tickets, view real-time flight information (such as availability and prices), and manage their bookings. Additionally, it provides a platform for admins to manage airports, routes, and flights, while also collecting user feedback.

 **Project Overview:**
The **Flight Management System** is a web-based application designed to facilitate both **customer flight booking** and **admin management of flight operations**. The primary goal of this project is to streamline the booking process for customers, allow admins to efficiently manage flight-related information, and provide real-time updates regarding flight availability, pricing, and routes.

 **Proposed Solution:**
The web application has been built to support two primary roles: **Admin** and **Customer**. 
- **Admins** can manage airports, routes, flights, and view user feedback and details.
- **Customers** can register, log in, search for available flights, book tickets, and modify bookings.
This solution is effective because it centralizes all flight management tasks in one platform and provides a seamless, user-friendly interface for customers.

 **Technologies and Tools:**
- **Frontend:** JSP, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** Java, Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Spring Security
- **Database:** Used for storing flight, booking, and user information
- **Security:** Spring Security for handling user authentication and authorization

**My Role:**
In this project, I was involved in both the backend and frontend development. I worked on:
- **Implementing user authentication** using Spring Security.
- **Developing the passenger booking module**, allowing customers to search for flights, make bookings, and modify bookings.
- **Setting up flight and route management** for the admin role, enabling admin to add and manage airports, routes, and flights.
- **Database integration** using Spring Data JPA to store and manage flight and user data.

Challenges faced included ensuring data consistency, especially during the booking process, and implementing secure authentication to protect sensitive user data. 
We overcame these challenges by following best practices in web development, security, and database management.

 **Impact and Achievements:**
This system provides a streamlined process for both customers and admins. The major achievements include:
- **Real-time flight information**: Customers can view up-to-date availability and pricing for flights.
- **Easy booking process**: Customers can book, view, and modify their flight bookings.
- **Efficient management**: Admins can manage flights, routes, and user feedback all in one place.
- **Improved user experience**: Both customers and admins can perform their tasks more efficiently.

 **Team Collaboration:**
This was a group project, and I collaborated closely with my teammates. We divided tasks based on our expertise, with some focusing on backend development and others on frontend development.
We communicated regularly to ensure smooth integration between the different modules and maintained version control using Git.

 **Learning and Development:**
From this project, I gained valuable experience in using **Spring Boot** for backend development and **JSP** for frontend development.
I also strengthened my understanding of web application security using **Spring Security**. 
In the future, I would focus more on optimizing performance, especially for high traffic scenarios, and integrating third-party APIs for flight information.

 **Flight Management System - Key Features:**

1. **Admin Dashboard:**
   - **Airport Management:** Admins can add, update, or delete airports along with their codes and cities.
   - **Flight and Route Management:** Admins can add flight details, schedule routes, and view customer feedback.
   - **View Feedback:** Admins can see feedback provided by users regarding their booking experience.

2. **Customer Dashboard:**
   - **Registration and Login:** Customers must register and log in to access the system.
   - **Flight Search:** After logging in, customers can search for available flights based on source and destination cities.
   - **Booking Process:** Customers can book a flight by providing personal details after selecting available flights.
   - **Modify Bookings:** Post-booking, customers can modify their flight reservations if needed.

3. **Airport Management:**
   - Admin adds airports with their codes and locations, which customers can view when searching for flights.

4. **Flight and Route Scheduling:**
   - Admin manages and schedules routes, and customers can view the available routes when selecting their flights.

5. **Ticket Generation:**
   - After a successful booking, the system generates a **ticket** for the customer.

6. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - The system offers real-time availability and flight status updates, ensuring customers have up-to-date information for their booking decisions.
